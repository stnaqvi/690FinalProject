# GatorChat!
Welcome to GatorChat! We've created this app to be a simple groupchat messaging application based on "Channels". The basic idea is that the user authenticates using their name and student ID to participate in a channel of their choice for eg class discussions etc. We will be using a Firebase framework integrated with Google Cloud, and work with xCode in order to make this app. The goal was to connect the Gators through this app for their group discussion without any hassle.
